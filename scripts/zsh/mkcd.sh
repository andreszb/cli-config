    echo "  Creates a directory (including parent directories if needed) and"

    echo "  mkcd <directory>   # Create directory and cd into it"

    echo "EXAMPLES:"
    echo "  mkcd my-project              # Create and enter 'my-project'"
    echo "  mkcd path/to/deep/folder     # Create nested path and enter it"

    echo "  • No error if directory already exists"

    echo "NOTES:"
    echo "  • Uses 'mkdir -p' internally for safe directory creation"
    echo "  • Only changes directory if mkdir succeeds"
    echo "  • Directory name is required (no default behavior)"
